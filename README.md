# ⚙️ Component Language Pack - Remix Edition

> **📢 IMPORTANT:** This is a modified fork of the original [Component Language Pack by ExoAE](https://github.com/ExoAE/ScCompLangPack).
> **All credit for the original language pack goes to [ExoAE](https://github.com/ExoAE).**
> This remix was created using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to provide an alternative compact naming format.

## 💡 Why Did I Make This?

> [!NOTE]
> **Quick-scan ship components without the guesswork!**
>
> When you scan a ship, you want to know **immediately** if it has components worth looting - without having to:
> - Spend time retrieving the ship
> - Look up component names online
>
> This remix puts the critical stats **first**, so you can make instant decisions while scanning. See `M2A` at the start? You know it's Military, Size 2, A-grade. Decision made. Move on or loot up!

## 🎯 What's Different in This Remix?

This version uses a **compact naming format** that puts the important stats first:

**Original format:**
`XL-1` → `XL-1 S2 Military A`

**Remix format:**
`XL-1` → `M2A XL-1`

The format is: **[Type][Size][Quality] [Component Name]**

**Type abbreviations:**
- **M** = Military
- **I** = Industrial
- **C** = Civilian
- **R** = Racing (Competition renamed to avoid conflict with Civilian)
- **S** = Stealth

**More examples:**
- `QuadraCell MT` → `M2A QuadraCell MT` (Military, Size 2, Quality A)
- `Eco-Flow` → `I1B Eco-Flow` (Industrial, Size 1, Quality B)
- `Cryo-Star` → `C1B Cryo-Star` (Civilian, Size 1, Quality B)
- `AbsoluteZero` → `R2B AbsoluteZero` (Racing, Size 2, Quality B)
- `NightFall` → `S2A NightFall` (Stealth, Size 2, Quality A)

## 🛠️ Create Your Own Language Pack

Want to create your own custom language pack? Use the **[SC Global.ini Extractor](https://github.com/BeltaKoda/SC-GlobalIni-Extractor)** to extract the vanilla `global.ini` file from Star Citizen, then modify it to your preferences!

This tool was created to make building this language pack easier, and it's now available for the community to create their own custom packs.

**Note:** The extraction tool is currently in beta. If you encounter any issues with it, please report them in the [tool's issue tracker](https://github.com/BeltaKoda/SC-GlobalIni-Extractor/issues).
